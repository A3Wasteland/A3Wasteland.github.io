	<p>
		By making a voluntary donation to A3Wasteland, you reward the developers for their hard work and time invested in making an open-source Wasteland gamemode freely available to all. Donating will not give you any in-game perk or advantage over other players, in accordance with Bohemia's <a href="http://www.bistudio.com/community/game-content-usage-rules">Game Content Usage Rules</a>. Also, donating will not give you any priority in the development process, e.g. requests like "I gave $X now please add Y feature" will be declined.
	</p>
	<p>Most of the money received will be spent toward college tuition and website fees.</p>
